I refined my assets combining the table and the room into one and adding to it the theme of the transitional style.  The lines and curves are all fairly straight, there's lots of window space for a sort of style that is meant to be between the modern era and the classical era, giving it a blanced timeless look.  Now I don't think I perfectly executed on the theme, but I did my best!  The Table is a design I took from a photo of a table like that.  The window space is the same and the table is located in a good spot for the theme.  I also added a simple white box that is meant to be a painting as a modifiable asset.
