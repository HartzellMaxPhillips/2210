I made the room and table white boxes by mostly reverse-engineering what Anthony did in class.  It was a mind-blowing discovery to be able to set parameters to reference other parameters.  My room is perfectly square with the walls sitting on top of the edges of the floor.  The twist I added to the room is that I can make multiple windows by copying the box that the Boolean is made from.  I also made a circle table pretty much exactly like the one Anthony did in
