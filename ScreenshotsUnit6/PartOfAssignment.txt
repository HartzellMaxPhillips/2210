I have a set of themes.
1) The Backyard.  I want to capture the fun I had outside as a child or at least the environment I was in as a kid
2) Autumn.  Reds, oranges, browns.  Things are dying and going into hibernation for winter
3) Suburbs.  I look out the window towards the center of the block and I see backyards with grass and trees and trampolines and a fence up.
4) Fantasy.  I plan to add strange and stylized elements that make it look like a touch of magic has been added

The primary way I've applied these themes so far are color.  The secondary is by choosing materials such as the gravel that would more commonly be found in the backyards and not big rocks like there are out in the mountains.
